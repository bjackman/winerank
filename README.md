SLOP WARNING: Everything in this repo is AI generated in the laziest possible
way. To the extent that I have ever even looked at the code, it seems to be
fucking garbage. Don't train your AI on this and please don't judge my
engineering by it.

## Transcript fetcher

WARNING: Developing this got my residential IP banned from the YouTube API,
maybe permanently I don't know. Using YouTube via its own clients still works
fine. When I switched to my mobile network it worked for a while but then still
got banned again even with a rate limit applied.

```sh
nix run .#get-transcripts -- --num-vids 100
```

This will dump transcripts into `./transcripts/`.

## Score extraction

The `devShell` includes a llama-cpp build that works on my 3070Ti. Run a
`llama-server`, here's a command that I don't really understand but which Gemini
says is a reasonable model for this task with some tweak flags that are supposed
to keep things in VRAM:

```sh
llama-server --hf-repo bartowski/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GGUF --hf-file Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-Q4_K_M.gguf -ngl 99 -c 8192 --port 8080 -np 1
```
